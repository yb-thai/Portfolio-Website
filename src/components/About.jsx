        I'm a Cloud/DevOps Engineer with experience supporting enterprise customers at
  Amazon, helping them build, troubleshoot, and scale their EKS and AWS applications.
  I specialize in diagnosing complex infrastructure issues and improving cloud
  reliability through automation and best practices..
      </p>
        <p className="section-text">
        At Amazon, I work directly with enterprise customers to troubleshoot complex EKS and AWS infrastructure issues, 
        optimize performance, and guide teams on architecture best practices. My work focuses heavily on Kubernetes, networking, 
        IAM, and cloud automation.
      </p>
      <p className="section-text">
        I enjoy working with tools like Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab CI/CD,
  Jenkins, and AWS services such as EKS, EC2, VPC, and CloudFormation. I'm
  constantly learning and refining my skills to deliver faster, more secure, and
  more resilient cloud platforms.
      </p>

      <p className="section-text">
        Outside of engineering, I enjoy gaming, learning new tech, riding motocycle and contributing to side projects like my multi-bot Discord voice relay system.
